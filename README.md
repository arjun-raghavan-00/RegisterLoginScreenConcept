# RegisterLoginScreenConcept
A concept for a Registration/Login screen for Android apps (written in Kotlin). The screen is based on a custom ViewPager that scrolls vertically instead of horizontally and is "infinite".

Inspired by [this login concept by Vasyl Paliy](https://github.com/vpaliyX/LoginConcept/) (as seen on his article on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@vpaliy/do-you-dare-me-to-implement-this-login-screen-bf29b72d9e39).

## To-Do:
* Add animations and stuff like shared element transitions to spice it up a little beyond just plain scrolling from one screen to another.
